title: Over A Decade...

It has been over a decade since I visited [Chandeen’s official site](https://web.archive.org/web/20040226193420/http://www.chandeen.com/) for the first time, after I, by chance, listened to the <cite>Echoes</cite> album. I still remember the words on the homepage clearly:

> Chandeen have decided to dissolve the band!

You couldn’t imagine how bad I was feeling at the moment. I just got to know them, and they told me that they were done with it? I kept coming back to see whether there was a turn for the better. And no! Never! But I was still hoping.

Till one day, a new album called <cite>Teenage Poetry</cite>. Immediately, I recognized that wasn’t Antje Schulz’s voice. And I knew there wouldn’t be a turn any more. So I kept myself away from those albums came later. It was not fair to Julia Beyer, but I just can’t.

Recently, I started listening to <cite>Blood Red Skies</cite>, as I gradually accepted the fact that Antje wouldn’t come back. Honestly, it is a beautiful album, especially the song [<cite>Shadows Fade</cite>](http://y.qq.com/y/static/mv/mv_play.html?vid=i00167ye6f3). And I knew, sooner or later I had to get over it. However, one thing might not change, my favorite albums are still <cite>Echoes</cite> and <cite>Jutland</cite>, my cell phone ringtone is still <cite>Jutland / One Last View</cite>.

After all, she’s not the <q>echoes</q>. She’s not Antje.

I miss Antje.
